# 📖 DSOM Operational Guide: Comprehensive AI Governance

This guide provides the technical depth behind the **Deep State of Mind (DSOM) Protocol**. It is designed for the Senior Systems Architect to maintain high-availability (HA) context and **Clean Architecture** integrity across disparate AI agents.

## 🏛️ Core Principles of Operation

1.  **Sovereign Logic First:** Business rules (Entities/Use Cases) must be defined before framework implementation (Adapters/Drivers).
2.  **Linguistic Precision:** All documentation and code comments strictly follow **UK English** and **DBP-standard Bahasa Melayu Malaysia (Piawai)**.
3.  **Metacognitive Persistence:** AI state is volatile; the Git repository is the only "Source of Truth."

## 🌅 Section 1: Reanimation (Start-of-Day Ritual)

Reanimation is not just opening a chat; it is the **Initialisation of a Cognitive Twin**.

* **The Audit:** Verify that the local environment (Podman containers, Linux logs) matches the last recorded state in `walkthrough.md`.
* **The Directive Injection:** By loading `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`, you set the "Guardrails." This prevents the AI from drifting into non-standard coding patterns or Indonesian vocabulary.
* **Contextual Handshake:** Use the "Handshake" to ensure the AI's internal weights are aligned with the project's **Clean Architecture** layers. If the AI cannot explain the "Why" behind the last Mental Anchor, do not proceed.

## 🛠️ Section 2: Active Flow (The Guardrails)

Maintaining a **Clean DSOM (C-DSOM)** requires constant vigilance.

* **The CRISP Filter:**
    - **Context Awareness:** Refer to `.agent/brain/` before every architectural decision.
    - **Review & Record:** Update `walkthrough.md` immediately after a logic breakthrough—*before* the code is even finished.
    - **Iteration:** Apply **Atomic Git Hygiene**. Commit one file at a time using `type(scope): message`.
    - **Single-purpose:** If a task spans multiple Clean Architecture layers, break it into separate prompts.
    - **Partnership:** Challenge the AI. If it suggests a global variable, invoke the **Zero-Global Pattern** law.

## 🌙 Section 3: Hibernation (The Context-Preservation Ritual)

In an HA-Ready mindset, Hibernation is a **Graceful Shutdown** with state persistence.

### 🧠 1. Defining the Mental Anchor (The "Why")
The **Mental Anchor** is the bridge between today's logic and tomorrow's execution. Without it, you waste the first 30 minutes of the next session "remembering" where you left off.
* **Focus on the "Unfinished":** Don't just list what is done; list the **unresolved tension**.
* **The Intent:** Record *why* you chose a specific path (e.g., "Used Python Dataclasses for immutability to support HA state sharing").

### 📝 2. Updating Artifacts (The "How")
We move the "Live Memory" into "Persistent Storage" by updating the `.agent/brain/` directory.
* **`walkthrough.md`:** This is your **Long-term Memory**. Every decision, failure, and pivot is recorded here to prevent repeating mistakes.
* **`task.md`:** This is your **Working Memory**. Update the "Tugasan" list to reflect real-world progress and set the next SOD (Start-of-Day) target.

### 💾 3. The Sovereign Save (The "Proof")
We use **Atomic Git Hygiene** to ensure the brain artifacts are versioned. This is your "Off-site Backup."
* **Atomic Commitment:** Committing `.agent/brain/*.md` separately creates a historical timeline of your **Cognitive Digital Twin's** evolution.
* **Traceability:** Use the commit format `dsom(sync): hibernation save - [Anchor Summary]`.

### 🗣️ 4. The Parting Instruction (The "Handover")
This is a **Metacognitive Briefing**. By asking the AI to summarise technical hurdles, you force the AI to compress its current context into a portable **Transfer Packet**.
* **The Benefit:** This summary serves as the "Pre-flight Briefing" for the next session, allowing for an instant **Context Sync** across different AI models.
