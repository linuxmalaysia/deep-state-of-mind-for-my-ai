# 🏛️ Digital Sovereignty Operational Model (DSOM)

> **"Digital Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice—sovereign choice."**

## 1. Executive Overview

A Digital Sovereignty Operational Model (DSOM) is a strategic framework enabling nations, organisations, or individuals to maintain independent control over their digital destiny, including data, technology, and infrastructure. It ensures that digital operations comply with local laws and security standards, preventing unauthorised external access or over-reliance on foreign entities.

## 2. The Three Sovereign Pillars

### ⚖️ Data Sovereignty

* **Definition:** Full control over the lifecycle of data—where it is stored, how it is processed, and who accesses it.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Using the `.agent/brain/` directory as a local, non-volatile data store. We use global AI for processing but keep the "Golden Record" of our logic on sovereign soil.

### ⚙️ Technology Sovereignty

* **Definition:** Independence in choosing technology stacks, specifically reducing reliance on proprietary foreign vendor lock-in.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Strict adherence to **Open Source Standards** (Linux, Ansible, Podman). Our code and protocols are "Provider-Agnostic."

### 🛡️ Operational Sovereignty

* **Definition:** The capability to manage, monitor, and maintain critical digital infrastructure internally, ensuring continuity without foreign interference or support dependency.
* **DSOM Implementation:** The use of **SOD/EOD Rituals** and local shell scripts (`reanimate.sh`, `audit-pre-flight.sh`) so that the project can survive even if external AI APIs are throttled or revoked.

## 3. Implementation Strategies

### ☁️ Sovereign Cloud Models

Utilising dedicated, locally operated infrastructure (e.g., Thales/S3NS in France, T-Systems in Germany) that provides physical and logical separation from global providers.

### 🔀 Hybrid-Sovereign Approach

This is the core of our current protocol. We categorise workloads:

1. **Critical Workload (Sovereign):** Architectural intent, security keys, and business logic stored in the `.agent/brain/`.
2. **Commodity Workload (Public):** LLM pattern matching and code generation via global AI providers.

### 📜 Regulatory Compliance

Adhering to strict legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR, Malaysia’s PDPA, and data residency laws). Our protocol ensures that no sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) leaves the node, enforced by `privacy-guardian.sh`.

## 4. Benefits vs. Challenges

| **Category** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Benefits** | Increased security, reduced legal risks, protection of intellectual property, and enhanced privacy. |
| ⚠️ **Challenges** | Initial higher complexity/cost, the need for high-skilled local personnel, and potential isolation from some global features. |

## 5. Mapping to the Deep State of Mind (DSoM) Protocol

The **Digital Sovereignty Operational Model (DSOM)** provides the **"Why"** (Strategy), while the **Deep State of Mind (DSoM)** provides the **"How"** (Metacognition).

* **Strategy:** We must be sovereign.
* **Tactic:** We use CRISP² and local artifacts to prevent the AI from becoming the "Master" of our knowledge.
