# 🏥 DSOM ITIL 4 Alignment Strategy

> **"Value Co-creation through Service Relationships."**

## 1. 🏛️ The Service Relationship
In the DSOM Framework, the relationship between the **Lead Architect (Harisfazillah Jamel)** and the **AI Agent (Gemini/Claude)** is defined as a **Service Relationship**.

* **Service Provider:** The AI Agent (Providing Intelligence, Code Generation, and Analysis).
* **Service Consumer:** The Lead Architect (Defining Requirements, Constraints, and Value).
* **Asset:** The Codebase and Documentation (`.agent/brain`).

The goal is not just "Output" (Code), but **"Outcome"** (Sovereign, Maintainable, and Scalable Infrastructure).

---

## 2. 🔄 The Service Value Chain (SVC)
Every "Task" or "Prompt" issued to the AI executes the DSOM Service Value Chain:

### i) Engage (The Handshake)
* **ITIL Action:** Understand stakeholder needs.
* **DSOM Implementation:** The `reanimate.sh` process. The AI *engages* with the `task.md` and `walkthrough.md`.
* **Artifact:** `sod_manifest.txt`

### ii) Plan (The Architectural Design)
* **ITIL Action:** Ensure shared understanding of the vision.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Verifying `implementation_plan.md` and `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`.
* **Artifact:** `task.md` (Updated)

### iii) Design & Transition (The Logic)
* **ITIL Action:** Meeting requirements.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Writing logical intent in `walkthrough.md` *before* writing code.
* **Artifact:** `walkthrough.md` (Mental Anchor)

### iv) Obtain/Build (The Execution)
* **ITIL Action:** Creation of service components.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Writing code using **Atomic Git Hygiene**.
* **Artifact:** Source Code (`tools/`, `src/`)

### v) Deliver & Support (The Verification)
* **ITIL Action:** Ensuring value co-creation.
* **DSOM Implementation:** Running `audit-pre-flight.sh` and `privacy-guardian.sh`.
* **Artifact:** `CHANGELOG.md`

### vi) Improve (The Sunday Audit)
* **ITIL Action:** Continual improvement of products and services.
* **DSOM Implementation:** The **Sunday Human Audit** to refine the protocol.
* **Artifact:** Protocol updates and `HISTORY.md`.

## 3. 🧠 Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS)
The `.agent/brain/` directory constitutes the project's **SKMS**. It is the Single Source of Truth for:

* **Service Portfolio:** `implementation_plan.md` (Strategic roadmap).
* **Service Catalogue:** `OPERATIONAL-GUIDE.md` (Capabilities).
* **Configuration Management (CMS):** `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` (Current state).

---

## 4. 📈 Continual Improvement (The 7 Guiding Principles)
1.  **Focus on Value:** Does this verify Sovereignty?
2.  **Start Where You Are:** Use `reanimate.sh` for context.
3.  **Progress Iteratively with Feedback:** Atomic Commits.
4.  **Collaborate and Promote Visibility:** Update `walkthrough.md`.
5.  **Think and Work Holistically:** Respect `Zero-Global`.
6.  **Keep it Simple and Practical:** No over-engineering.
7.  **Optimize and Automate:** Build `tools/` for repetition.

---

## 5. 🛡️ Governance & Risk Management
Governance ensures accountability and risk mitigation across all AI‑assisted development.
* **Governance Gates:** Automated checks in `.github/workflows/` enforce compliance.
* **Risk Mitigation:** `privacy-guardian.sh` applies a fail‑closed principle.
* **Artifact:** `GOVERNANCE.md` and audit logs.

---

## 6. 🌐 Multi‑Agent Federation
DSOM recognises multiple AI agents as equal peers in a federated ecosystem.
* **Hub‑and‑Spoke Model:** Synchronises IDE agents and autonomous workers.
* **Equal Peers:** Each agent contributes intelligence within its domain.
* **Artifact:** `MULTI-AGENT-PROTOCOLS.md`.

---

## 7. 📊 Metrics & Measurement
Performance and value delivery are tracked using quantitative metrics.
* **CPI/SPI:** Embedded in `implementation_plan.md` (Cost/Schedule Performance).
* **Audit Scripts:** Generate reports on task completion and compliance.
* **Artifact:** `metrics_report.md`.

---

## 8. 🔄 Feedback & Incident Management
DSOM integrates ITIL incident and request handling into its workflow.
* **Incidents (Bugs):** Logged in `walkthrough.md` as part of the audit trail.
* **Service Requests (Features):** Tracked in `task.md` for execution.
* **Artifact:** `INCIDENTS.md` and `REQUESTS.md`.

---

## 9. 🧩 Integration with CRISP²
ITIL phases are mapped directly to DSOM’s CRISP² hierarchy:
* **Engage ↔ L1 Rituals:** Handshake and reanimation.
* **Plan ↔ L2 Mandates:** CRISP pillars define scope.
* **Design & Transition ↔ L3 Specialised Tasks:** Clean Architecture.
* **Audit ↔ L4 Process Instances:** Mental anchors and audit trails.

---

## 10. 📜 Compliance & Standards
DSOM enforces external standards to ensure portability.
* **Documentation:** Follows Linux Documentation Project (LDP) structure.
* **Semantic Integrity:** Adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.
* **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` records all notable changes.
