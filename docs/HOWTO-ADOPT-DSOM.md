# HOWTO: Adopt DSOM in Existing Projects (Brownfield)

**Author:** Harisfazillah Jamel  
**Version:** 1.0 (DSOM v5.2)  
**License:** GPLv3  

> **Scenario 1:** You have an active development project (PHP, Python, Node, etc.) and you want to install the DSOM Protocol to stop context decay.

---

## 1. Introduction
This guide explains how to "retro-fit" the Deep State of Mind (DSOM) framework into a running repository. It effectively transforms a standard code repo into a **Cognitive Digital Twin**.

**Target Audience:** Lead Architects, Senior Developers.

## 2. Prerequisites
*   **Git Repository:** The project must be version-controlled.
*   **Linux/WSL:** You need a Bash-compatible environment (or PowerShell 7+ on Windows).
*   **Access:** Write permissions to the root of the repository.

## 3. The Procedure

### Step 1: Clone the Tooling
You need the `tools/` and `docs/` directories from the DSOM master repository.

**Option A: Submodule (Recommended)**
If you want to keep updated with DSOM core changes:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/linuxmalaysia/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai.git .dsom-core
cp -r .dsom-core/tools .
cp -r .dsom-core/docs .
```

**Option B: Direct Copy**
Clone DSOM elsewhere and copy the folders:
```bash
# In a temporary folder
git clone https://github.com/linuxmalaysia/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai.git dsom-temp
# In your target project
cp -r ../dsom-temp/tools .
cp -r ../dsom-temp/docs .
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Brain
Run the initializer to create the `.agent/brain/` structure. This script is **non-destructive**—it will not overwrite existing work, but since you are adopting, these files likely don't exist yet.

```bash
bash tools/init-brain.sh
```
*Output:* Created `task.md`, `walkthrough.md`, `implementation_plan.md`.

### Step 3: The First Context Injection
You must now manually populate the "Brain" with your project's current state.

1.  **Edit `.agent/brain/implementation_plan.md`:**
    *   Delete the boilerplate.
    *   Write a high-level summary of your *current* project roadmap (Phases).
2.  **Edit `.agent/brain/task.md`:**
    *   List the immediate bugs or features you are working on *today*.
3.  **Edit `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md`:**
    *   Add a "Session Anchor" summarizing the recent history of the project so the AI knows "where we came from."

### Step 4: Security Hardening
Establish the security perimeter immediately.

1.  **Run Privacy Guardian:**
    ```bash
    bash tools/privacy-guardian.sh
    ```
2.  **Update .gitignore:**
    Ensure `.agent/brain/*.md` is **NOT IGNORED** (so you can sync context), but `.env` and `*.sql` **ARE IGNORED**.

```gitignore
!/.agent/brain/*.md
```

### Step 5: The First Reanimation
Generate your first "Cognitive Handshake" manifest.

```bash
bash tools/reanimate.sh
```

**Action:** Upload the generated `sod_manifest.txt` to your AI (Gemini/Claude) and verify it understands your existing codebase structure.

## 4. Troubleshooting

**Q: The script says "Not a Git Repository".**  
A: Ensure you are running the command from the root of your project. Run `git init` if it's not versioned yet.

**Q: The AI thinks it's a new project.**  
A: You skipped **Step 3**. The AI only knows what is in the `.agent/brain` files. If you leave them empty, it assumes a blank slate.
