# 🧠 Deep State of Mind (DSOM) Protocol

> **Bridging the gap between Human Architectural Intent and AI Execution for Open Source Sovereignty.**

## 📝 Description

**Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** is a metacognitive framework designed to prevent "Context Decay" in AI-assisted software development. While standard AI interactions are transactional, DSOM is **persistent and structural**.

It was forged in the **CMSForNerd v3.5 Laboratory** to ensure that AI agents (Gemini, Copilot, Cursor) operate not just as coders, but as **Cognitive Digital Twins** of the Lead Architect. It enforces high-availability standards, strict architectural laws (Zero-Global, Pair-Logic), and pedagogical integrity across long-term open-source projects.

### Key Features

* **State Persistence:** Uses `.agent/brain/` artifacts to bridge sessions.
* **Architectural Guardrails:** Hard-coded "Why" logic that rejects substandard AI suggestions.
* **Intelligence Audit:** Mandatory "Reality Checks" against Git logs and physical environments before execution.
* **Sovereignty Focused:** Prioritizes Linux-agnostic, portable, and secure open-source solutions.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Requirements

* **Target Environment:** Linux (Enterprise-ready: AlmaLinux, Ubuntu Server, RHEL).
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **AI Access:** High-reasoning models (Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4, or specialized coding LLMs).

### Setup

1. **Clone the Architecture:** Create the brain directory in your project root:
```bash
mkdir -p .agent/brain

```


2. **Initialize Artifacts:** Create your first `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` using the DSOM templates.
3. **Deploy Pre-Flight:** Add the `audit-pre-flight.sh` script to your tools directory to enforce session integrity.

---

## 🚀 Usage

To engage DSOM, initialize your AI session with the **Master Directive**.

**Example Prompt:**

> "Initialize DSOM Protocol. Reference `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` and perform the Intelligence Audit. Synchronize with `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md` before proposing code."

**Expected Output:**
The AI will acknowledge your architectural laws (e.g., "Zero-Global Pattern") and refuse to proceed until it has verified the current Git delta.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [x] **v3.5:** Formalization of the Master Protocol and Pair-Logic sync.
* [ ] **v4.0:** Integration of automated "Deep Audit" logs via Git hooks.
* [ ] **Community:** Release of DSOM templates for Ansible, Python, and Rust.

## 🤝 Contributing

I welcome contributions to the DSOM ecosystem!

1. **Strictness:** All PRs must include a `walkthrough.md` explaining the "Why."
2. **Standards:** Code must pass `composer compliance` (or language equivalent) at the highest strictness level.
3. **Documentation:** New patterns must be documented in the Project Knowledge Graph.
