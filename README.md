## 🛠️ Framework Overview
The **Deep State of Mind (DSOM) For My AI Protocol** ensures architectural sovereignty through:
1.  **Contextual Persistence:** Using `.agent/brain/` artifacts.
2.  **Multi-AI Alignment:** Synchronising Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.
3.  **Linguistic Standards:** UK English and DBP-standard Malay.

## 🏛️ The Sovereign Framework (5W1H)

The **Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** is a metacognitive governance framework designed to prevent "Context Decay" in AI-assisted development. It transforms a standard LLM into a **Cognitive Digital Twin** of the Lead Architect.

* **Who:** Managed by the **Lead Architect** (Harisfazillah Jamel) and the **AI Partner**.
* **What:** Integrates **Clean Architecture** with the **CRISP Operational Strategy**.
* **When:** Executed daily via **SOD/EOD Rituals** and weekly via the **Sunday Audit**.
* **Where:** Hosted in the sovereign `.agent/brain/` artifacts.
* **Why:** To ensure **Sovereign Portability** and eliminate vendor lock-in.
* **How:** Enforced through **Atomic Git Hygiene** and mandatory Handshake protocols.

### 🏛️ Section 1.1: The CRISP² Methodological Hierarchy

To maintain **Sovereign Integrity**, the DSOM protocol is structured using a four-level hierarchical process model. This ensures that every action taken by the **Cognitive Digital Twin** is mapped to a specific level of abstraction.

| Level | CRISP-DM Category | DSOM Implementation | SSoT Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | **Phases** | **Rituals:** Start-of-Day (SOD), Active Flow, and End-of-Day (EOD). | `RITUAL-OF-TRANSITION.md` |
| **L2** | **Generic Tasks** | **Mandates:** The CRISP Pillars (Context, Review, Iteration, Single-purpose, Partnership). | `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` |
| **L3** | **Specialised Tasks** | **Architectural Layers:** Implementation of Entities, Use Cases, and Drivers. | `OPERATIONAL-GUIDE.md` |
| **L4** | **Process Instances** | **History:** The concrete record of logic breakthroughs and mental anchors. | `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md` |

### 🧠 The Logic of the Hierarchy (The 'Why')

* **Stability (L1-L2):** The Phases and Mandates are **Stable**. They do not change regardless of whether the project is in Python, PHP, or Bash.
* **Flexibility (L3):** The Specialised Tasks adapt to the **Clean Architecture** requirements of the specific project.
* **Auditability (L4):** The Process Instances provide the **Audit Trail** required for the **Sunday Human Refresh**, ensuring the Architect's mental map is always in sync with the repository state.

## 📝 Description

**Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** is a metacognitive framework designed to prevent "Context Decay" in AI-assisted software development. While standard AI interactions are transactional, DSOM creates a **persistent and structural** bridge between the developer's expertise and the AI's generation capabilities.

The Deep State of Mind (DSOM) protocol is designed to ensure the synchronisation of architectural intent across diverse AI agents. It prioritises the authorisation of local 'Brain' artifacts as the single source of truth, preventing vendor lock-in and ensuring sovereign portability.

This project provides the tools and directory structures necessary to transform a standard AI (like Google Gemini, Claude, Copilot or ChatGPT) into a **Cognitive Digital Twin** of the Lead Architect. It enforces high-availability standards, strict architectural laws, and pedagogical integrity across long-term open-source projects.

It was forged in the **CMSForNerd v3.5 Laboratory** to ensure that AI agents (Gemini, Copilot, Cursor) operate not just as coders, but as **Cognitive Digital Twins** of the Lead Architect. It enforces high-availability standards, strict architectural laws (Zero-Global, Pair-Logic), and pedagogical integrity across long-term open-source projects.

### Features

* **State Persistence:** Uses `.agent/brain/` artifacts to bridge sessions and maintain context across different AI chats.
* **Intelligence Audit:** A mandatory "Pre-Flight" script verifies the physical environment and Git state before any code is written.
* **Root-Aware Automation:** Tools are designed to function correctly from any subdirectory within a Git repository.
* **Sovereignty Focused:** Built specifically for Linux-agnostic, portable, and secure open-source development under the GPLv3 license.

## 🖼️ Visuals

The DSOM workflow ensures that the AI's "Mind" is always synced with the "Physical" state of the code.


```text
[ Physical Git State ] <---> [ .agent/brain/ ] <---> [ AI Agent Intelligence ]
          ^                        |                          ^
          |________________________|__________________________|
                         (The DSOM Handshake)

```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Requirements

* **Operating System:** Linux (Optimized for Enterprise distributions like Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, RHEL).
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **Environment:** Any programming language (The auditor auto-detects PHP, Node.js, Python, and Go).

### Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/linuxmalaysia/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai.git
    cd deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai
    ```
2.  **Initialize the Brain:**
    Create the required context files (this will not overwrite existing files):
    ```bash
    bash tools/init-brain.sh
    ```
3.  **Set Permissions:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x tools/*.sh
    ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. The Pre-Flight Audit

Before starting any development session, run the auditor to ensure your Git state and environment are ready:

```bash
./tools/audit-pre-flight.sh

```

### 2. Engaging the AI

Initialize your AI session by providing it with the contents of the `.agent/brain/` folder. This gives the AI your "Deep State of Mind" regarding:

* **task.md**: What we are doing right now.
* **walkthrough.md**: What we did in the last session.
* **implementation_plan.md**: The long-term roadmap.

The `implementation_plan.md` must serve as the **Long-Term Strategic Roadmap**. Unlike `task.md` (which is for today) or `walkthrough.md` (which is for the past), this file defines the **Vision** and **Phases** of the DSOM project.

To engage DSOM, initialize your AI session with the **Master Directive**.

**Example Prompt:**

> "Initialize DSOM Protocol. Reference `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` and perform the Intelligence Audit. Synchronize with `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md` `.agent/brain/task.md` and `.agent/brain/implementation_plan.md` before proposing code."

**Expected Output:**
The AI will acknowledge your architectural laws (e.g., "Zero-Global Pattern") and refuse to proceed until it has verified the current Git delta.

## 🚀 The Reanimation Engine (`tools/reanimate.sh`)

The `reanimate.sh` script is the primary mechanism for maintaining the **Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** across different AI sessions, providers (Gemini, Claude, GPT), or hardware changes. It automates the "Knowledge Injection" process required for a successful Start of Day (SOD).

### 🛠️ What it Does
1. **Aggregates Brain Artifacts:** Combines `task.md`, the full `walkthrough.md`, and `implementation_plan.md`.
2. **Contextualizes Identity:** Injects the `README.md` and `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` to establish the AI's role and the Lead Architect's authority.
3. **Physical Sync:** Appends the last 30 Git commits to ensure the AI understands the actual code changes made on disk.
4. **Manual State Injection:** Prompts the user for any uncommitted "Mental Flow" or Master Prompt overrides from previous sessions.
5. **Enforces Handshake:** Appends the mandatory Handshake command for the AI to summarize the last Mental Anchor.

### 📋 Usage (Start of Day Ritual)

1. **Generate the Manifest:**
   ```bash
   bash tools/reanimate.sh

2. **Review & Secure:**
Run `tools/privacy-guardian.sh` to ensure no sensitive data is present in the generated `sod_manifest_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.
3. **Reanimate the AI:**
Upload the manifest file to your AI chat and provide the following prompt:
> *"Summarize the current Mental Anchor after you have read the file uploaded."*

* **Output:** Both terminal screen and a timestamped file (`sod_manifest_yyyy-mm-dd.txt`).


## 🕯️ The Ritual of Transition (Persistence Logic)

To maintain the **Deep State of Mind** across different AI models (Gemini, Claude, or local LLMs) and different accounts, users must follow the **Ritual of Transition**. 

This protocol ensures that:
1.  The AI is **reanimated** with the correct architectural laws.
2.  The "Mental Anchor" is preserved so work resumes exactly where it stopped.
3.  The project remains **Sovereign**—independent of any specific AI provider's memory limits.

See [docs/RITUAL-OF-TRANSITION.md](docs/RITUAL-OF-TRANSITION.md) for the full checklist.

---

We will break down these three core files using the **Why, What, Who, When, and How** framework. This ensures that any user (or AI agent) understands not just the content, but the strategic intent behind them.

### 1. `.agent/brain/task.md`

**The "Cutting Edge" of Development**

* **WHY:** To solve "Short-Term Memory Loss" in AI. Without this, an AI agent often forgets the specific sub-task it was working on if the chat session is interrupted or hits a token limit.
* **WHAT:** A granular, checklist-oriented file that tracks immediate objectives. It represents the "Present" state of the project.
* **WHO:** Managed by the **AI Agent** (under human supervision). The AI updates this file as it completes sub-tasks to provide a "handover" for the next session.
* **WHEN:** Updated **continuously** during a work session. Every time a feature is finished or a bug is squashed, this file is modified.
* **HOW:** * Use Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` for pending, `- [x]` for done).
* Keep tasks "Atomic"—no task should be so large that it takes more than one session to complete.
* Always verify against this file during the "Morning Ritual" handshake.

---

### 2. `.agent/brain/implementation_plan.md`

**The Strategic Roadmap**

* **WHY:** To ensure the project doesn't suffer from "Scope Creep." It anchors the AI to the long-term vision so it doesn't suggest refactors that contradict the final goal.
* **WHAT:** A high-level document divided into Phases (e.g., Phase 1: Infrastructure, Phase 2: Core Logic). It represents the "Future" state of the project.
* **WHO:** Authored by the **Lead Architect (Harisfazillah Jamel)**. The AI refers to this as a "Non-Negotiable" map.
* **WHEN:** Created at the **start of a project** and updated only when there is a major shift in technical strategy or versioning (e.g., moving from v4.1 to v5.0).
* **HOW:**
* List major technical milestones (e.g., "Implement HA Clustering").
* Define the "Definition of Done" for each phase.
* The AI must trigger a **Stop Condition** if a user request deviates from this plan.

---

### 3. `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`

**The Sovereign Constitution**

* **WHY:** To enforce "Architectural Sovereignty." It prevents the AI from acting like a generic chatbot and forces it to adopt the persona of a Senior Systems Architect who respects 35+ years of ICT standards.
* **WHAT:** The primary governance document containing the "Laws of the System" (Zero-Global Pattern, Sovereign Portability, Pedagogical Documentation).
* **WHO:** The **Supreme Authority** for all AI Agents. It is the first document "injected" into any new AI session.
* **WHEN:** Consulted **every time a new chat session begins** or when a model switch (e.g., Gemini to Claude) occurs.
* **HOW:**
* Contains the **Handshake Protocol** (The mandatory questions the AI must ask before coding).
* Defines the **Execution Standards** (VCS Hygiene, Language requirements like PHP 8.4+).
* Establishes the **Identity** of the AI as the "Cognitive Digital Twin" of the Lead Architect.

---

## 🕯️ The Rituals of Transition

### 🌅 1. Reanimation (Start-of-Day)
Before writing code, run the bootloader to inject the "Deep State" into the AI:
```bash
bash tools/reanimate.sh

```

*Ask the AI:* "Summarise the current Mental Anchor and verify layer compliance."

### 🛠️ 2. Active Flow (The Guardrails)

Maintain the **Zero-Global Pattern** and **Sovereign Portability**. Update the `walkthrough.md` after every successful logic breakthrough.

### 🌙 3. Hibernation (End-of-Session)

Secure the session state to prevent context loss:

1. Define the **Mental Anchor** (current logical stopping point).
2. Update `task.md` with tomorrow's **SOD targets**.
3. Perform a **Sovereign Save** (Atomic commit of brain artifacts).
4. Request a **Metacognitive Briefing** for the next agent.

### 📅 4. Sunday Audit (Human Refresh)

Every Sunday, the Lead Architect performs a **Dry-Run Audit** of all repository files to re-index the human mental map and ensure system-wide synchronisation.

## 🏗️ Starting a New Project (The DSOM Template)

You can use this repository as a boilerplate for any new AI-assisted project.

### 📋 Cloning Workflow
1. **Clone the DSOM framework:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/linuxmalaysia/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai.git](https://github.com/linuxmalaysia/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai.git) my-new-app
   cd my-new-app

```

2. **Run the Reset Tool:**
```bash
bash tools/template-reset.sh

```


*This will delete the old `.git` history, initialize a fresh Git repo, and clear the brain files.*
3. **Initialize the AI:**
Generate your first manifest (`bash tools/reanimate.sh`) and use the **Universal DSOM Reanimation Prompt** to start your new Gemini/Claude session.

## 🏛️ Technical Architecture
This project implements the **Deep State of Mind (DSOM) For My AI Protocol** layered with **Clean Architecture** principles:

* **Sovereign Logic:** Framework-independent core.
* **Layered Security:** Clear boundaries between business logic and drivers.
* **AI-Navigable:** Structured for high-precision context retrieval via CRISP strategy.

## 🛡️ The DOSM CRISP Operational Strategy

To prevent context decay and architectural drift, all interactions within this repository follow the **DOSM CRISP** strategy. This ensures the "Sovereign Core" remains untainted by AI hallucinations.

1. **Context Awareness:** Always initialise sessions by synchronising with the `.agent/brain/` artifacts.
2. **Review & Record:** Every logic change must be documented in `walkthrough.md` and committed via **Atomic Git Hygiene**.
3. **Iteration:** Progress is achieved through incremental, atomic changes. We avoid monolithic refactors to maintain stability.
4. **Single-purpose Prompts:** Each interaction must focus on a specific sub-task (e.g., a single Use Case or Entity) to ensure high-precision output.
5. **Partnership:** The AI operates as a **Senior Systems Architect (Cognitive Digital Twin)**, upholding the standards set by Harisfazillah Jamel.

---

**CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is the industry-standard methodology for managing data science and data mining projects. Developed in the late 1990s by a consortium including Daimler-Benz, NCR, and SPSS, it was designed to be **non-proprietary**, **tool-neutral**, and **application-independent**.

### 🏛️ The 4-Level Hierarchical Structure

One of the most powerful (and often overlooked) aspects of CRISP-DM is its hierarchical process model. It breaks down projects into four levels of abstraction:

1. **Phases (L1):** High-level stages of the data mining process (e.g., Business Understanding).
2. **Generic Tasks (L2):** Stable actions that apply to all projects (e.g., "Clean Data").
3. **Specialised Tasks (L3):** Specific actions tailored to a particular situation (e.g., "Clean missing categorical values in a SQL database").
4. **Process Instances (L4):** A concrete record of what *actually* happened in a specific project (e.g., the logs of a Python cleaning script run on Jan 12th).

### 🔄 The 6 Operational Phases

The life cycle of a CRISP-DM project is cyclical, meaning insights from later phases often trigger a return to earlier ones.

1. **Business Understanding:** Focuses on project objectives from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding:** Initial collection and familiarisation to identify quality issues or hidden insights.
3. **Data Preparation:** The "heavy lifting" phase where data is cleaned, transformed, and formatted for modelling.
4. **Modelling:** Selecting and applying various modelling techniques (e.g., machine learning algorithms).
5. **Evaluation:** Ensuring the model actually meets the business objectives set in Phase 1.
6. **Deployment:** Organising the results and integrating the model into a production environment.

### 🧠 Why This Matters for Our AI Protocol

In our **DSOM framework**, we use this same hierarchy to prevent "Context Decay." By mapping your AI interactions to these levels:

* **L1-L2 (Rituals & Protocols):** Stay stable and never change.
* **L3 (Clean Architecture):** Adapts to the specific code.
* **L4 (Walkthrough Artifacts):** Captures the "Mental Anchor" of our current work.
