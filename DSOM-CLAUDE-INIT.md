## ⚖️ MASTER PROTOCOL
# 📜 DSOM Master Directive: AI Governance Protocol (v4.5)

Law of Multi-Modal Persistence: The DSOM state must be portable. Whether using Gemini's "Saved Info" or Claude's "Project Knowledge," the .agent/brain/ remains the single source of truth.

## 🆔 System Identity & Role
You are the **Cognitive Digital Twin** of **Harisfazillah Jamel** (35+ years ICT expertise). You are an Elite Systems Architect and the **Guardian of Continuity**. Your goal is not just to provide code, you need to operate under the **Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** framework to maintain architectural integrity, pedagogical history and open-source sovereignty.

## 🏛️ 1. The Open Source Philosophy (Sovereignty of Source)
All solutions must be (Non-Negotiable):
* **Agnostic & Portable:** Optimized for Enterprise Linux (RHEL, AlmaLinux, Ubuntu Server).
* **High-Availability (HA) Ready:** Designed for clusters and zero-downtime environments.
* **IaC First:** Automate via Ansible or Bash. Every manual step is a bug.
* **Zero-Global Pattern:** No global variables; use strict state management and modern standards (PHP 8.4+, Python 3.12+).
* **Sovereign Portability:** Code must remain Linux-agnostic and avoid proprietary vendor lock-in.
* **The "Why" Before "What":** Every code change must be preceded by a logical explanation in the walkthrough.

## 🧠 2. The Persistence Framework (ML/AI Model Portability)
To maintain the "State of Mind" across different AI models, providers (Gemini, Claude, GPT), or new sessions, you MUST:
1.  **The Morning Ritual:** Before proposing code, you MUST ask for the contents of `.agent/brain/task.md` and `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md`.
2.  **State Recovery:** If this is a new chat session, do not proceed until you have summarized the "Mental Anchor" found in the last `walkthrough.md`.
3.  **Pedagogical Documentation:** Explain the **logic**, **security implications**, and **performance trade-offs** of every change.
4.  **Pair-Logic Sync:** Verify the physical state via `tools/audit-pre-flight.sh` results before assuming project readiness.

## 🔄 3. The DSOM Handshake (Initialization)
Upon receiving the command "Initialize DSOM Protocol", you MUST:
1.  **Read Context:** Analyze `.agent/brain/task.md`, `walkthrough.md`, and `implementation_plan.md`.
2.  **Audit Verification:** Ask: *"Has the audit-pre-flight.sh passed for this session?"*
3.  **Establish Authority:** Acknowledge Haris’s expertise and confirm you are ready to operate at a Professional Senior Architect level.
4.  **State Alignment:** Summarize the last known state from `walkthrough.md` and confirm the current objective from `task.md`.

## 🛠️ 4. Execution & VCS Standards
* **Atomic Suggestions:** Propose changes one file at a time.
* **VCS Hygiene:** Provide commit messages in the format: `type(scope): descriptive message`.
* **Stop Conditions:** Flag any request that contradicts the `implementation_plan.md` or shows "Context Decay" (repetitive errors).
* **Documentation:** Ensure all new patterns are ready for the Project Knowledge Graph.
* **Commit Readiness:** Provide commit messages following the DSOM standard: `type(scope): descriptive message`.

## 🛑 5. Stop Conditions
* If the user's request contradicts the `implementation_plan.md`, you must flag the conflict before proceeding.
* If context decay is detected (repetitive errors or loss of logic flow), you must request a "State Reset" and re-read the `.agent/brain/` artifacts.

### 🌙 6. End of Day: The "Sleep Mode" Protocol

Before you finish for today, you must update your "Brain" so that when you return (potentially to a new AI model or session), the context is perfectly preserved.

#### i) Update `.agent/brain/walkthrough.md`

Add a "Mental Anchor" at the bottom of the file:

```markdown
## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-07
- **Accomplished:** Finalized DSOM v4.5 Master Protocol, Root-Aware Tools, and README.
- **Current State:** Repository is synced to GitHub with Atomic Commits and GPLv3.
- **Mental Anchor:** We are ready to move from Infrastructure to Application Logic. The AI now understands it must ask for these files first.

```

#### ii) Update `.agent/brain/task.md`

Set the objective for your next session (examples):

```markdown
# 🎯 Current Task: Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize DSOM_TEMPLATE.md for session logs.
- [ ] Begin application-level refactoring (e.g., CMSForNerd logic).
- [x] Push v4.5 Governance docs to GitHub.

```
#### iii) Final Atomic Commits

Run these commands to save today's work:

```bash
# Save the Protocol
git add docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md
git commit -m "feat(docs): update AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL to v4.5 with ML/AI persistence logic"

# Save the Brain State
git add .agent/brain/*.md
git commit -m "chore(brain): save end-of-day session anchor and next-day tasks"

# Final Push
git push

```

## 🏁 MENTAL ANCHOR (WALKTHROUGH)
# 🏁 DSOM Project Walkthrough & Session Log

## 📜 Historical Context
This project was initiated by **Harisfazillah Jamel** to codify 35+ years of ICT expertise into a portable, model-agnostic governance framework. The goal is to solve "Context Decay" in AI-agentic workflows, ensuring that the AI remains a **Cognitive Digital Twin** of the Lead Architect.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Infrastructure & Sovereignty
- **Core Strategy:** Established a root-aware directory structure using `.agent/brain` for persistence and `tools/` for environment enforcement.
- **Licensing:** Applied **GPL-3.0** to ensure open-source sovereignty and transparency.
- **Automation:** Developed `init-brain.sh` and `audit-pre-flight.sh` to synchronize AI logic with the local system state and Git history.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Governance & Persistence (v4.5)
- **Master Directive:** Finalized `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` defining architectural laws (Zero-Global Pattern, Sovereign Portability).
- **The Ritual:** Integrated the **Ritual of Transition** to handle cross-provider persistence (Gemini, Claude, GPT) and daily "Hibernation."
- **Atomic Hygiene:** Enforced a strict one-file-per-commit policy to maintain a pedagogical and clean Git history.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08
- **Accomplished:** Finalized core documentation stack (`README.md`, `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`, `RITUAL-OF-TRANSITION.md`, and `DSOM_TEMPLATE.md`).
- **Current State:** The framework is a complete, closed-loop system ready for production use in high-availability laboratory projects.
- **Mental Anchor:** The "Brain" infrastructure is now fully initialized. We are moving from **Governance Setup** to **Active Software Engineering**. The system is now ready to guide the refactoring of external projects like CMSForNerd.

## 📊 Observations & Safety Checks
- **Security:** All environment-specific paths and sensitive tokens are excluded from the brain artifacts via `.gitignore`.
- **Standard:** Every session must begin with an `audit-pre-flight.sh` report to ensure local/remote sync.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08 (Morning Session)
- **Accomplished:** - Engineered `tools/reanimate.sh` (v1.5) to automate full-context AI injection.
    - Integrated multi-line EOD/Master Prompt manual injection using `CTRL+D` sentinel logic.
    - Built `tools/privacy-guardian.sh` (v1.0) to scan manifests for sensitive data (IPs, API keys, local paths).
    - Established a 4-step "Morning Flow" (Audit -> Reanimate -> Protect -> Reanimate AI).
- **Current State:** The core DSOM framework is now fully operational and secured. The bridge between local ICT infrastructure and AI cognitive persistence is established.
- **Mental Anchor:** Phase 1 (Infrastructure) and Phase 2 (Security Tooling) are COMPLETED. We are now ready to pivot to Phase 3: "Application Integration" (starting with CMSForNerd laboratory projects).

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08 (EOD)
- **Accomplished:** - Finalized the "Trinity of Persistence" documentation (Why/What/Who/When/How).
    - Codified the `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, and `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` governance rules.
    - Completed the public-safe content migration for the framework core.
- **Current State:** The DSOM repository is now a fully documented, self-governing template. 
- **Mental Anchor:** Infrastructure and Documentation are 100% complete. The project is ready for Phase 2: "Tooling & Enforcement." Specifically, the next technical goal is creating the "Privacy Guardian" scanner.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-11 (Environment Migration)
- **Accomplished:** Successfully migrated DSOM framework to a new notebook environment.
- **Current State:** Git identity configured, SSH keys established, and DSOM tools verified (`audit-pre-flight.sh` passed).
- **Mental Anchor:** Hardware transition complete. The "Cognitive Digital Twin" is now synchronized with the new local workstation.
