# 🗺️ DSOM Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a robust, model-agnostic governance framework that allows AI agents to operate as high-level systems architects, preserving the expertise of Harisfazillah Jamel across any AI provider or session.

## 🏛️ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] **Project Scaffolding:** Root-aware directory structure and initialization scripts.
- [x] **Sovereignty Foundation:** GPL-3.0 licensing and open-source documentation.
- [x] **The Rituals:** Codifying the Start-of-Day (Reanimation) and End-of-Day (Hibernation) protocols.
- [x] **AI Master Protocol:** Establishing architectural laws (Zero-Global, Portable, Pedagogical).

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Tooling & Enforcement (Current)
- [x] **Privacy Guardian:** Script to scan `.agent/brain` for sensitive data before commits.
- [x] **Context Injection Tool:** A script to automatically concatenate brain artifacts for easy copy-pasting into AI prompts.
- [x] **State-Sync Automator:** Enhance `audit-pre-flight.sh` to provide deeper environment telemetry (e.g., dependency versions).
- [x] **Windows Platform Support:** Create native PowerShell (`.ps1`) equivalents of all tooling to support Windows developers without WSL.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Documentation Infrastructure & Publishing
- [x] **Shell Script Documentation:** Auto-generate markdown docs for all `tools/*.sh` scripts, extracting comments into `tools-and-automation/`.
- [x] **Multi-Platform Readiness:** Structure the repo for compatibility with Docusaurus, MkDocs, and mdBook (Universal `SUMMARY.md`).
- [x] **Content Synchronization:** Ensure all new markdown files (including Agent Configs) are linked in `book.json` / `SUMMARY.md`.

## 📈 Phase 4: Scaling & Community
## 📈 Phase 4: Scaling & Community
- [ ] **Community Health Files:** Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to enforce DSOM compliance (e.g., "Did you run audit-pre-flight?").
- [ ] **Automated Walkthrough:** Develop `tools/generate-walkthrough.sh` to auto-draft session logs from git history.
- [ ] **Social Readiness:** Final review of `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ensure it links to the new templates.
