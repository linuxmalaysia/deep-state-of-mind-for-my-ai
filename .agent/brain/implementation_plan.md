# 🗺️ DSOM Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a robust, model-agnostic governance framework that allows AI agents to operate as high-level systems architects, preserving the expertise of Harisfazillah Jamel across any AI provider or session.

## 🏛️ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] **Project Scaffolding:** Root-aware directory structure and initialization scripts.
- [x] **Sovereignty Foundation:** GPL-3.0 licensing and open-source documentation.
- [x] **The Rituals:** Codifying the Start-of-Day (Reanimation) and End-of-Day (Hibernation) protocols.
- [x] **AI Master Protocol:** Establishing architectural laws (Zero-Global, Portable, Pedagogical).

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Tooling & Enforcement (Current)
- [x] **Privacy Guardian:** Script to scan `.agent/brain` for sensitive data before commits.
- [x] **Context Injection Tool:** A script to automatically concatenate brain artifacts for easy copy-pasting into AI prompts.
- [x] **State-Sync Automator:** Enhance `audit-pre-flight.sh` to provide deeper environment telemetry (e.g., dependency versions).
- [x] **Windows Platform Support:** Create native PowerShell (`.ps1`) equivalents of all tooling to support Windows developers without WSL.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Application Integration
- [ ] **CMSForNerd Integration:** Apply DSOM to the CMSForNerd v3.5 laboratory.
- [ ] **Pattern Library:** Create a "Knowledge Graph" of recurring architectural patterns (PHP 8.4 hooks, HA cluster configs).
- [ ] **Multi-Model Testing:** Verify DSOM persistence by migrating a single project state between Gemini, Claude, and local Llama-3 models.

## 📈 Phase 4: Scaling & Community
- [ ] **Contributor Guide:** Standardizing how external contributors must interact with the DSOM "Brain."
- [ ] **Automated Session Summaries:** Use AI to generate the `walkthrough.md` entry automatically at the end of a session.
