# 🗺️ DSOM Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a robust, model-agnostic governance framework that allows AI agents to operate as high-level systems architects, preserving the expertise of Harisfazillah Jamel across any AI provider or session.

## 🏛️ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] **Project Scaffolding:** Root-aware directory structure and initialization scripts.
- [x] **Sovereignty Foundation:** GPL-3.0 licensing and open-source documentation.
- [x] **The Rituals:** Codifying the Start-of-Day (Reanimation) and End-of-Day (Hibernation) protocols.
- [x] **AI Master Protocol:** Establishing architectural laws (Zero-Global, Portable, Pedagogical).

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Tooling & Enforcement (Current)
- [x] **Privacy Guardian:** Script to scan `.agent/brain` for sensitive data before commits.
- [x] **Context Injection Tool:** A script to automatically concatenate brain artifacts for easy copy-pasting into AI prompts.
- [x] **State-Sync Automator:** Enhance `audit-pre-flight.sh` to provide deeper environment telemetry (e.g., dependency versions).
- [x] **Windows Platform Support:** Create native PowerShell (`.ps1`) equivalents of all tooling to support Windows developers without WSL.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Documentation Infrastructure & Publishing
- [x] **Shell Script Documentation:** Auto-generate markdown docs for all `tools/*.sh` scripts, extracting comments into `tools-and-automation/`.
- [x] **Multi-Platform Readiness:** Structure the repo for compatibility with Docusaurus, MkDocs, and mdBook (Universal `SUMMARY.md`).
- [x] **Content Synchronization:** Ensure all new markdown files (including Agent Configs) are linked in `book.json` / `SUMMARY.md`.

## 📈 Phase 4: Scaling & Community
- [x] **Community Health Files:** Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to enforce DSOM compliance (e.g., "Did you run audit-pre-flight?").
- [x] **Automated Walkthrough:** Develop `tools/generate-walkthrough.sh` to auto-draft session logs from git history.
- [x] **Social Readiness:** Final review of `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ensure it links to the new templates.

## 🔒 Phase 5: Privacy & Security Hardening
- [x] **Expanded Heuristics:** Update `privacy-guardian` to detect Emails, AWS Keys, and GitHub Tokens.
- [x] **Gitignore Auditing:** Add exclusions for common data dump formats (`*.sql`, `*.csv` in root).
- [x] **Security Documentation:** Update `docs/SECURITY.md` (if exists) or `privacy-guardian.md` with new patterns.

## 🏛️ Phase 6: ITIL 4 Service Management Alignment
- [x] **Protocol Update:** Inject "ITIL 4 Service Management" into `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`.
- [x] **Knowledge Base:** Create `docs/ITIL-ALIGNMENT.md` defining the Service Value Chain (SVC).
- [x] **SKMS Integration:** Refactor `summary` and `brain` definitions to align with Knowledge Management standards.

## 📚 Phase 7: Adoption & Upgrade Guides
- [x] **Brownfield Guide:** Create `docs/HOWTO-ADOPT-DSOM.md` for existing projects.
- [x] **Upgrade Guide:** Create `docs/HOWTO-UPGRADE-DSOM.md` for v4 -> v5 migration.
- [x] **Ops Integration:** Link new guides in `docs/OPERATIONAL-GUIDE.md` and `SUMMARY.md`.
