# 🏁 Deep State Of Mind for My AI (DSOM) Project Walkthrough & Session Log

## 📜 Historical Context
This project was initiated by **Harisfazillah Jamel** to codify 35+ years of ICT expertise into a portable, model-agnostic governance framework. The goal is to solve "Context Decay" in AI-agentic workflows, ensuring that the AI remains a **Cognitive Digital Twin** of the Lead Architect.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Infrastructure & Sovereignty
- **Core Strategy:** Established a root-aware directory structure using `.agent/brain` for persistence and `tools/` for environment enforcement.
- **Licensing:** Applied **GPL-3.0** to ensure open-source sovereignty and transparency.
- **Automation:** Developed `init-brain.sh` and `audit-pre-flight.sh` to synchronize AI logic with the local system state and Git history.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Governance & Persistence (v4.5)
- **Master Directive:** Finalized `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` defining architectural laws (Zero-Global Pattern, Sovereign Portability).
- **The Ritual:** Integrated the **Ritual of Transition** to handle cross-provider persistence (Gemini, Claude, GPT) and daily "Hibernation."
- **Atomic Hygiene:** Enforced a strict one-file-per-commit policy to maintain a pedagogical and clean Git history.

## 🛰️ Mental Anchor: [2026-01-11]
### Decision: Integration of Clean Architecture

**Context:** Standardising the project structure to prevent "Big Ball of Mud" degradation during AI-assisted development.

**Logic:**
By adopting Clean Architecture, we ensure **Sovereign Portability**. If we decide to move from Python to Node.js or from Podman to a bare-metal HA cluster, our **Entities** and **Use Cases** remain untouched.

**CRISP Application:**
- **S**ingle-purpose: We build one layer at a time.
- **I**teration: Starting from the Entity (SitemapNode) and moving outwards.


# 📜 DSOM END-OF-DAY (EOD) MANIFEST

**Date:** 2026-01-11

**Project:** Deep State of Mind (DSOM) For My AI Protocol

**Architect:** Harisfazillah Jamel (LinuxMalaysia)

**Status:** Architecture Hardened & Synchronised

---

## ✅ Accomplishments (Tugasan Selesai)

1. **CRISP Strategy Integration:** Formally embedded the CRISP mandate into the `reanimate.sh` tool and Gemini's core persona.
2. **Clean Architecture Alignment:** Codified the **C-DSOM** standard in `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`, enforcing the concentric dependency rule (Entities → Use Cases → Adapters).
3. **Sovereign Documentation:** Updated `README.md` with a professional disclaimer and a clear project purpose statement for the LinuxMalaysia community.
4. **Brain Sync:** Unignored the `.agent/brain/` directory to ensure GitBook cloud rendering of the "Sovereign Core."
5. **Community Outreach:** Generated a strategic blog post for `linuxmalaysia.com` to communicate the DSOM value proposition.

## 📍 Current Mental Anchor (Walkthrough.md Summary)

We have transitioned from a simple task-tracking protocol to a robust **Architectural Governance System**. The project is now structured to handle complex code generation (like the upcoming Recursive Crawler) without losing the "Inner Circle" logic to framework-specific drift.

---

### 🏛️ 1. Clean Architecture (The Skeleton)

**Definition:** A structural philosophy that organises software into concentric layers based on their level of "purity."

* **The Law:** Source code dependencies must only point **inwards**.
* **The Layers:**
1. **Entities (Sovereign Core):** Pure domain logic (e.g., our `SitemapNode`). It knows nothing of the outside world.
2. **Use Cases (Interactors):** The orchestration of logic.
3. **Interface Adapters:** The translators (converts data for DBs or APIs).
4. **Frameworks & Drivers (The Edge):** The volatile "tools" (Podman, RHEL, SQL).


* **Relation to DSOM:** It provides the **map**. It tells us *where* a piece of logic belongs so that we don't end up with a "Big Ball of Mud" that confuses the AI.

---

### 🛡️ 2. The CRISP Strategy (The Nervous System)

**Definition:** An operational filter designed to manage the flow of information between the Human Architect and the AI Cognitive Twin.

* **C - Context Awareness:** Synchronising with the `.agent/brain/` before acting.
* **R - Review & Record:** The "Black Box" of the operation. If it isn't recorded in `walkthrough.md`, it didn't happen.
* **I - Iteration:** Atomic, incremental changes. No monolithic "big bangs."
* **S - Single-purpose:** One prompt = One specific sub-task. This prevents "Attention Drift" in the AI.
* **P - Partnership:** Treating the AI as a Senior peer, not a tool. This maintains high technical and linguistic standards.
* **Relation to DSOM:** It provides the **protocol**. It is the set of rules that governs *how* we interact with the AI to ensure the "Skeleton" (Clean Architecture) remains upright.

---

### 🧠 3. DSOM of My AI (The Memory/State)

**Definition:** The overarching **Metacognitive Governance Framework**.

* **The Goal:** To prevent **Context Decay**.
* **The Mechanism:** Using persistent artifacts (`.agent/brain/`) and specific rituals (Reanimation & Hibernation) to ensure that "knowledge" persists even if the AI chat is deleted or the agent is swapped.
* **Relation to the others:** DSOM is the **container**. It holds the Clean Architecture structure and enforces the CRISP strategy across time.

---

### 🔗 The Unified Synthesis (C-DSOM)

When we combine them, we get **C-DSOM**:

> "We use the **CRISP Strategy** (How) to build **Clean Architecture** (What) within the **DSOM Framework** (Persistence)."

* If we have Clean Architecture but no CRISP, the AI will eventually break the layers because it loses context.
* If we have CRISP but no Clean Architecture, we will have very well-documented but messy, framework-dependent code.
* **Together:** We achieve **Sovereign Portability**. Your logic is clean, your process is documented, and your AI is always in sync with your mind.

### 🏛️ The C-DSOM Master Framework (5W1H)

| Dimension | **Clean Architecture** (The Skeleton) | **CRISP Strategy** (The Nervous System) | **DSOM Protocol** (The Persistence) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **WHO?** | **The Entity:** The core domain logic that owns the truth. | **The Partners:** The Architect (Haris) and the Twin (AI). | **The Sovereign:** The Human Mind (The ultimate anchor). |
| **WHAT?** | **Layered Separation:** Entities, Use Cases, Adapters, Drivers. | **Operational Filters:** Context, Review, Iteration, Single-purpose, Partnership. | **Metacognitive Governance:** Rituals, Artifacts, and Memory Persistence. |
| **WHEN?** | **Design Time:** Deciding where code lives based on its purpose. | **Active Flow:** Every single prompt and response during the session. | **The Lifecycle:** Reanimation (SOD), Active Work, and Hibernation (EOD). |
| **WHERE?** | **Spatial Logic:** Concentric circles where the center is pure. | **The Interface:** The dialogue window and the Git commit messages. | **The Brain:** The `.agent/brain/` directory and the GitBook cloud. |
| **WHY?** | **Portability:** To avoid vendor/framework lock-in (Sovereignty). | **Precision:** To prevent AI hallucinations and "Attention Drift." | **Persistence:** To ensure context survives across different AI agents/days. |
| **HOW?** | **Dependency Rule:** Logic points inward; outer layers don't touch core. | **CRISP Rituals:** Constant documentation and atomic commits. | **Atomic Git Hygiene:** Ensuring every thought is versioned and synced. |

---

### 🔗 The Relationship Dynamics

1. **DSOM (The Container):** Provides the **"When"** and **"Where"**. It defines when we start (SOD), when we stop (EOD), and where we store the memory (`.agent/brain/`).
2. **Clean Architecture (The Structure):** Provides the **"What"** and **"Why"**. It defines what we are building and why the code is structured in a sovereign, framework-agnostic way.
3. **CRISP Strategy (The Execution):** Provides the **"How"** and **"Who"**. It defines how the partners (Haris and Gemini) interact to ensure the Structure is built correctly inside the Container.

### 🧠 The Sunday Audit Logic

The reason we perform the **Sunday Audit** (The Dry-Run) is to verify that all **23 files** in the repo are correctly serving these dimensions.

* *Does a file in `tools/` (Driver Layer) accidentally contain Business Logic?* (Clean Architecture violation).
* *Was the last update to `walkthrough.md` atomic?* (CRISP violation).
* *Is the Mental Anchor clear enough to survive a week?* (DSOM violation).
