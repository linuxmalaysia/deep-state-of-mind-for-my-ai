# 🏁 DSOM Project Walkthrough & Session Log

## 📜 Historical Context
This project was initiated by **Harisfazillah Jamel** to codify 35+ years of ICT expertise into a portable, model-agnostic governance framework. The goal is to solve "Context Decay" in AI-agentic workflows, ensuring that the AI remains a **Cognitive Digital Twin** of the Lead Architect.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Infrastructure & Sovereignty
- **Core Strategy:** Established a root-aware directory structure using `.agent/brain` for persistence and `tools/` for environment enforcement.
- **Licensing:** Applied **GPL-3.0** to ensure open-source sovereignty and transparency.
- **Automation:** Developed `init-brain.sh` and `audit-pre-flight.sh` to synchronize AI logic with the local system state and Git history.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Governance & Persistence (v4.5)
- **Master Directive:** Finalized `docs/AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` defining architectural laws (Zero-Global Pattern, Sovereign Portability).
- **The Ritual:** Integrated the **Ritual of Transition** to handle cross-provider persistence (Gemini, Claude, GPT) and daily "Hibernation."
- **Atomic Hygiene:** Enforced a strict one-file-per-commit policy to maintain a pedagogical and clean Git history.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08
- **Accomplished:** Finalized core documentation stack (`README.md`, `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md`, `RITUAL-OF-TRANSITION.md`, and `DSOM_TEMPLATE.md`).
- **Current State:** The framework is a complete, closed-loop system ready for production use in high-availability laboratory projects.
- **Mental Anchor:** The "Brain" infrastructure is now fully initialized. We are moving from **Governance Setup** to **Active Software Engineering**. The system is now ready to guide the refactoring of external projects like CMSForNerd.

## 📊 Observations & Safety Checks
- **Security:** All environment-specific paths and sensitive tokens are excluded from the brain artifacts via `.gitignore`.
- **Standard:** Every session must begin with an `audit-pre-flight.sh` report to ensure local/remote sync.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08 (Morning Session)
- **Accomplished:** - Engineered `tools/reanimate.sh` (v1.5) to automate full-context AI injection.
    - Integrated multi-line EOD/Master Prompt manual injection using `CTRL+D` sentinel logic.
    - Built `tools/privacy-guardian.sh` (v1.0) to scan manifests for sensitive data (IPs, API keys, local paths).
    - Established a 4-step "Morning Flow" (Audit -> Reanimate -> Protect -> Reanimate AI).
- **Current State:** The core DSOM framework is now fully operational and secured. The bridge between local ICT infrastructure and AI cognitive persistence is established.
- **Mental Anchor:** Phase 1 (Infrastructure) and Phase 2 (Security Tooling) are COMPLETED. We are now ready to pivot to Phase 3: "Application Integration" (starting with CMSForNerd laboratory projects).

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-08 (EOD)
- **Accomplished:** - Finalized the "Trinity of Persistence" documentation (Why/What/Who/When/How).
    - Codified the `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, and `AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md` governance rules.
    - Completed the public-safe content migration for the framework core.
- **Current State:** The DSOM repository is now a fully documented, self-governing template. 
- **Mental Anchor:** Infrastructure and Documentation are 100% complete. The project is ready for Phase 2: "Tooling & Enforcement." Specifically, the next technical goal is creating the "Privacy Guardian" scanner.

## 🏁 Session Anchor: 2026-01-11 (Environment Migration)
- **Accomplished:** Successfully migrated DSOM framework to a new notebook environment.
- **Current State:** Git identity configured, SSH keys established, and DSOM tools verified (`audit-pre-flight.sh` passed).
- **Mental Anchor:** Hardware transition complete. The "Cognitive Digital Twin" is now synchronized with the new local workstation.
