Final Summary for Tomorrow:

"The DSOM project has transitioned from a set of scripts to a fully governed protocol. The 'Brain' is synced, the 'Constitution' is signed, and the 'Ritual of Transition' is documented. We are currently at the bridge between Governance Setup and Security Tooling. The system is stable and the Mental Flow is preserved."
