### 📅 The Sunday Audit Protocol (The "Human Refresh")

I have structured the audit sequence to flow from **Governance** to **Operations** to **Automation**. We will check each file for:

1. **Piawai Sync:** Does it follow DBP-standard Malay and UK English?
2. **C-DSOM Integrity:** Does it respect Clean Architecture and the CRISP Strategy?
3. **Logic Flow:** Does the "Why" (Pedagogical Logic) still hold true?

#### 🗺️ Step-by-Step Audit Map

**Phase 1: The Sovereign Governance (Root & Global Docs)**

1. `README.md` (The Entry Point & Disclaimer)
2. `LICENSE` & `CONTRIBUTING.md` (The Open Source Sovereignty)

### 🛠️ Updating SOD & EOD Rituals

To ensure this audit happens every Sunday, we will modify the **Start-of-Day (SOD)** and **End-of-Day (EOD)** manifests to be **Date & Time Aware**.

#### **Updated SOD (Start-of-Day):**

> *"Greetings, Architect. Today is [Day], [Date] at [Time]. Checking the Sunday Audit Schedule... [If Sunday: Trigger Phase 1 Audit]."*

#### **Updated EOD (End-of-Day):**

> *"Session Hibernation sequence initiated on [Day], [Date] at [Time]. [If Sunday: Confirm all 23 files have been audited and mental anchors updated]."*

*Last Synchronised: 2026-01-12*
