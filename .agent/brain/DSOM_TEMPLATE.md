# 🧠 DSOM Session Log: [Insert Date/Task Name]

## 🏗️ 1. The Architectural "Why"
*Explain the high-level reasoning behind the changes in this session. Why this pattern? Why this specific library? How does it serve the 35-year ICT standard?*

## 🛠️ 2. Implementation Logic
*Briefly list the technical steps taken. Focus on the 'how':*
- **Pattern used:** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Idempotent Scripting)
- **Constraint Handling:** (e.g., "Refused global variables to maintain Zero-Global Law")
- **Security/HA Considerations:** (e.g., "Non-root execution enforced")

## 🏁 3. Mental Anchor
*This is the most critical section for persistence. Describe exactly where the logic ends so the next AI can pick it up instantly.*
- **Current Completion:** (e.g., "Logic for Sitemap generation finished")
- **The "Thread":** (e.g., "We are mid-way through the index.php refactor; the next step is to handle the $context object injection.")
- **Mood/Context:** (e.g., "Standard DSOM protocol verified, readiness for high-availability testing.")

## 📊 4. Technical Debt & Blocks
*Note any issues encountered or items deferred to avoid breaking the "Deep Flow."*
